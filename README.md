# Reddit Mod Nuke Extension for Firefox

This code is a version of the [Reddit Mod Nuke Extension by Dr Jimbob](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-mod-nuke-extension/omndholfgmbafjdodldjlekckdneggll) on the Chrome Web Store repackaged and updated to be compatible with Firefox.

## Installation Instructions

Download the latest .xpi file from the [Releases](https://github.com/MikeRixWolfe/RedditModNuke/releases) page and Firefox should prompt you to install the extension. If it doesn't then navigate to `about:addons` in your browser, click the gear at the top right, and install the .xpi file as an extension.
